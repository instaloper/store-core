Store Core implements a decentralized, programmable database which provides a financial infrastructure that can empower billions of people.

## Note to Developers
* Store Core is a prototype.
* The APIs are constantly evolving and designed to demonstrate types of functionality. Expect substantial changes before the release.
* Weâ€™ve launched a testnet that is a live demonstration of an early prototype of the Store Blockchain software.
